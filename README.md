<h1> This is a basic command line script to play rock-paper-scissor against the computer.</h1>

The script is part of "TheOdinProject" Foundations course to learn JavaScript and experience with it. In later chapters a
GUI will be written for the script. At the moment it is just a coding project to learn the basics of JavaScript.

<h2> Test it out! </h2>

Here is the live preview of the site. 
If you are on it press CTRL + Shift + C to open the developer tools of your browser. Switch to console there to see the ouput of the game.

Now you can just enter "rock", "paper" or "scissor" (Case sensitiveness shouldn't matter, just check for the right spelling) and you should
be able to play 5 rounds of "Rock, paper, scissor" against the computer.

Good luck and have fun!
